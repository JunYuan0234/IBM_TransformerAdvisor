## Step 1 : Establish a Transformation Advisor Workspace and Collection.

In this demo journey, the objective is to leverage Transformation Advisor for a meticulous assessment of migration effort. The focal point is the transition of Customer Order Services application from the conventional WebSphere V 8.5.5 to a modern, cloud-ready runtime with minimal adjustments to the existing code. To initiate the utilization of Transformation Advisor (TA), the initial step involves the creation of a Workspace and Collection.

Think of a Workspace as a dedicated zone that encapsulates the migration recommendations provided by Transformation Advisor, tailored to each application server environment. The flexibility here lies in the ability to name and structure these Workspaces in alignment with personal preferencesâ€”whether it's based on business applications, geographical locations, or specific teams. On the TA homepage, I navigate to the 'Create new' button to establish a fresh Workspace explicitly named "CustomerOrderServices" for the purpose of this demo.

Furthermore, within each Workspace, there is the option to further compartmentalize the process by creating collections, allowing for a more targeted and nuanced approach to assessment and planning. Similar to Workspaces, these collections can be named and organized according to our discretion. In this demonstration, a Collection named "WAS855_AppSrv01" is formed, serving as the focus group for a more detailed and streamlined evaluation and planning process.

6. Once the workshop is created, the IBM Transformation Advisor will be ready to use as shown on the image above.

Within the TA collection page, you'll find two key tools: the Data Collector utility and the Data Uploader utility. The Data Collector utility, accessible from the Transformation Advisor web page, serves the purpose of retrieving application data from the Java application server operating in the client's environment. This Java utility can be effortlessly downloaded and executed against our Java application server, facilitating the comprehensive collection of all pertinent application data.

Upon running the utility, there are two options for managing the collected data. If Transformation Advisor (TA) is within the same network as the application server, the utility can seamlessly send the data directly back to TA. Alternatively, the utility also stores the collected data in a zip file, providing the convenience of uploading this file to a remote TA using the Data Uploader utility. This dual functionality ensures flexibility and accessibility in handling the collected application data based on the specific network configuration and requirements.

## STEP 2 : Download the Data Collector to gather necessary information.

Once the Workspace and Collection setup is complete, The page presented with the choice of either downloading the Data Collector utility or uploading an existing data file. In this demonstration, I'll walk through the process of using the Data Collector utility. To start, navigate to the download page where various versions of the utility are available, tailored to different application server operating systems such as WebSphere, WebLogic, and Tomcat.

Upon selecting the appropriate version, download the utility and save it locally on my workstation. This action results in a file named something like "transformationadvisor-Linux_CustomerOrderServices_WAS855_AppSrv01.tgz," which is stored in the local download directory. Following this, copy the command for extracting the Data Collector tar file from the Transformation Advisor download page.

Executing this command in the terminal window, located in the "Downloads" directory, leads to the successful extraction of the Data Collector. The extracted files are now stored in the "Downloads" directory. Using the 'cd' command, navigate to the directory, preparing anad stand-by for the subsequent step of running the Data Collector tool.

7. The above images shows the successful extraction of the Transformer Advisor Data Collector utility to the Downloads Directory. 

![Initial landing Page](/Image/14.png)

8. With the successful installation of the Data Collector, it is ready to execute it against my application server. The Transformation Advisor Data Collector Download page offers comprehensive guidance on running the tool. Notably, the Data Collector is versatile, capable of gathering data from various application server runtimes such as WebSphere, WebLogic, JBoss, Tomcat, and MQ. Additionally, the Transformation Advisor Data Collector provides the flexibility to narrow the scope of analysis at different levels, including application and configuration, application only, or ear/war files.

## STEP 3: Upload the results obtained from running the Data Collector.

Transformation Advisor undergoes regular updates, incorporating insights gathered from the field. Simultaneously, Liberty continues to enhance its capabilities, further simplifying the migration process. Consequently, it is advisable to consistently utilize the latest Transformation Advisor collector when initiating a new collection. It's important to note that the execution of the collector may entail a certain duration to generate the required zip file.

Therefore in this demonstration, a pre-created Data Collector zip file is used to upload to IBM Transformation Advisor by utilising the Transformation Advisor Upload utility feature to upload the file.After a few moment of uploading waiting time, the upload of the data collector results will be successfully completed. Once the Data Collector Results are uploaded to Transformation Advisor, a set of recommendations will be generated and displayed on the Recommendations page.

![Initial landing Page](/Image/15.png)

1. Navigate back to the WAS855_AppSrv01 directory as shown on the image above.

![Initial landing Page](/Image/16.png)

2. Then, click on the grey button which shows upload on it to upload data collector zip file.

![Initial landing Page](/Image/17.png)

3. Click on the "Drop or add file" to upload the file from local directory.

![Initial landing Page](/Image/18.png)

4. After located and added the zip file, click on the upload button to upload the file to Transformation Advisor.

![Initial landing Page](/Image/19.png)

5. After successfully uploading the Data Collector Results to Transformation Advisor, a series of recommendations will be generated and displayed on the Recommendations page, as shown on the image above.

On the Recommendations page, the identified migration source environment is presented in the Profile section, while the target environment is specified in the Migration Target section. The data collector tool recognizes the source environment as our WebSphere Application Server Traditional runtime with a WAS 8.5.5.20 AppSrv01 profile. The target environment is configured for Liberty Runtimes, serving as the default target environment.

The Recommendations page further provides a comprehensive summary analysis of all applications in the AppSrv01 environment slated for migration to a Liberty environment. Each application's details include its Name, Migration Target, Complexity, Issues, and the Estimated development cost in days.

For instance, considering the modresorts application's transition to a Liberty runtime, the complexity level is categorized as Simple, indicating that no modifications to the application code are required for migration. Consequently, the estimated development effort is zero days.

Notably, the recommendation page showcases both Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty as migration targets for the CustomerOrderServicesApp. A detailed explanation for this dual recommendation will be provided later in the presentation.

## STEP 4 : Dive into the analysis phase to review and understand the recommendations provided.

Now, let's direct our attention to the recommendations provided by Transformation Advisor specifically for the Customer Order Services application (CustomerOrderServicesApp.ear). According to Transformation Advisor's assessment, the projected effort required to migrate the Customer Order Services application from the traditional WebSphere V855 to Open Liberty (which accommodates JEE7, Java EE 8, and additional features) is estimated at 8 days of development time. To delve deeper into the analysis, let's examine the specific details pertaining to the Customer Order Services application.
